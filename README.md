# Professional Portfolio

## Objectives 
In this project, I created a cohesive portfolio page with a recent photo of myyself, my name, contact information and placeholders for links that will one day host my work. The placeholders are placed in a way that is responsive to different viewports. I also made sure that the first application image is larger then the others.
